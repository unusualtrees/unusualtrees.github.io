 <p>
 Under a solitary sun that shone from a point even higher than the zenith, stood a small group of entities who were alone at this point. Their exact number cannot be described, for their existence predates the concept of numbers, although some languages spoken in distant parts retain some inkling of this quantity, expressed with a hesitation and unconscious invocation of some long forgotten deity.
 </p>

 <p>
 Most aspects of reality we take for granted, time, space, matter, did not exist in this place, if it could be called a place. It was more of a concept. This place was governed by concepts wholly alien to our own, in fact precursors to our own, but so frightfully simple that they cannot be conceived of easily by brains so full of notions about how things ought to be.
 </p>

 <p>
 But these Ancient Masters, anyhow, they split up the duty of creating many aspects of our universe among themselves. Some granted us the idea of mass, others the idea of the strict duality of "existence" and "non-existence", and yet others the ideas of size, form, shape and truth.
 </p>

 <p>
 They had no concept of morality, and yet were to sow the seeds of countless bloody moralistic wars in times past and present, in times yet to exist, and in times sideways to our own, all of which were fought by groups trying to follow in their footsteps.
 </p>

 <p>
 For if one succeeded in doing what they did, reality could take whatever desirable aspects one wanted. Or rather,
 existence would always have had those aspects.
 </p>

 <p>
 Ten thousand years ago a cataclysmic event shook the Earth. A mass extinction event occurred to climatic changes
 brought about by the release of a massive amount of carbon dioxide, among other gases, into the atmosphere, in
 the space of 300 years. Analysis of soil records also shows a layer of polymeric residue during this time. Genetic analysis of human remains from this era shows that the human population reached a peak of perhaps ten billion individuals, before collapsing to around twenty million in as little as a century.
 </p>

 <p>
 Some have suggested that humans were responsible for the climatic change of this era, however this is hardly likely when it is universally acknowledged that cherishing all life on earth is fundamental to humanity. It forms
 the basic motto of all the Institutes of Earth.
 </p>

 <p>
 The Dark Ages ended eight thousand years ago with the discovery of a cure to the "viruses" of old, and the setting up of the first Institutes.
 </p>

 <p>
 Seven thousand years ago, a sect rose up against the Institutes, determined to impose their backwards hierarchies upon all life on Earth through the use of psychic abilities. The sect called themselves the Kollini, from an ancient word meaning "keepers of fire". They were defeated by the combined power of the Institutes in the only war to take place on Earth since the Dark Ages.
 </p>

 <p>
 The Kollini were banished from Earth and they set off into deep space, still working on their psychic incantations. They settled on a small, isolated world and called it Kollino.
 </p>

 <p>
 The Kollini discovered the existence of the Ancient Masters and their fervour grew even stronger. They worshipped
 the Ancient Masters as gods. True gods, with no semblance to any mortal being. They desired to become timeless
 gods themselves, augmenting their psychic capabilities as much as they could until they could manifest new concepts in their local bubble of reality.
</p>

 <p>
 It is said that Kollino fell some time afterwards, although their ruined world, which had been isolated into its own sphere of existence through the sheer will of its former inhabitants, still had terrible importance for what was to come.
 </p>

 <h2>3</h2>

 <p>
 Amongst older members of the district, vague murmurings of a looming entity in the area were reported.
 Additionally,
 although all the other researchers dismissed it as a coincidence at the time, many of the older generation,
 perhaps
 those 70+, had an unusually acute sense of smell, Hasselstrom noted.
 </p>

 <p>
 He decided to visit some of them on Tuesday, heading out in the van along with his assistant. The journey
 was
 perhaps ten minutes along the coast road. The sun was brilliant in the deep blue sky and Hasselstrom was
 unnerved by
 the cheeriness of the mid-June weather.
 </p>

 <p>
 Upon reaching the small collection of dwellings, he began making enquiries. Soon enough he found an
 informant
 and
 began to ask questions about local folklore.
 </p>

 <p>
 From what he could tell, the entire district was seen as a place of particular spiritual significance.
 Although
 the
 elderly speaker was fluent in English, he occasionally interjected with the odd phrase in the old language.
 </p>

 <p>
 "Are there any locations in this district that are particularly important in this regard?" Dr Hasselstrom
 asked.
 </p>

 <p>
 "Yes I would say so sir, there are indeed, there's the old well at the top of the cliff about a mile from
 here
 along
 the coast road. But I would not recommend going there, many have been lost going that way." the old man
 replied.
 </p>

 <p>
 With that Hasselstrom concluded the interview as haste occupied his mind. He ran out to the van with his
 assistant
 in tow, and both of them jumped in without hesitation. Without care for traffic regulations, he booted on
 down
 the
 road until he reached a layby near the location of this supposed well. His assistant was ordered to stay
 inside
 the
 van, lock it from the inside, and phone for help if Hasselstrom did not return within half an hour.
 </p>

 <p>
 Scampering down the brambly hillside, Hasselstrom frantically searched for any bits of stone jutting out
 that
 would
 indicate the current or former presence of a well. He climbed further and further down the slope, the
 tension
 mounting as the sheer vertical drop of the cliff came closer and closer.
 </p>

 <p>
 Mere metres before the cliff edge, he found the well. It was remarkably preserved, which was obvious from
 the
 look
 on his face. He stood silent for a few moments in pure terror. The type of intricate carving, combined with
 the
 archaic symbols and precise geospatial alignment and size of the various parts of the construction,
 confirmed
 his
 worst fears.
 </p>

 <p>
 This was of alien origin, pertaining to forces that were not entirely of this universe. But that was not
 all.
 The
 older locals talked of a presence—which could only mean that the entire area was permeated by an entity,
 bound
 to
 this plane of existence by certain anchor points—no, not anchor points, fountains, yes, that's a better
 description—from which the entity emanated.
 </p>

 <p>
 Hasselstrom felt a cold shiver down his back, and for a brief second thought he could no longer smell the
 deep
 earthy smell of the nearby vegetation. But he soon came to his senses and thought nothing of it.
 </p>

 <p>
 That research trip concluded a few days later with promising results. It seemed that in rural, isolated
 parts of
 the
 country, the same story was told with a remarkable degree of consistency. He plotted the locations on a map
 and
 realised they formed a geometric pattern.
 </p>

 <p>
 Additionally, detailed geospatial measurements of artefacts and structures found so far kept on returning
 small
 numerical errors: a millimetre here, a gram or two there. Despite painstaking error checking and rechecking,
 some of
 the numbers could not be made to add up.
 </p>

 <p>
 Hasselstrom and his team presented his results in that year's Ectropy Symposium to excellent reviews. The
 next
 year,
 he incorporated his latest findings into his lectures on the topic at the Planetary Institute.

 <hr>
 <h2>4</h2>

 <p>
 The spaceliner glided through the void like an iceskate on a frozen polar lake. Or "arctic" lake, as some
 people
 said, although Aldri had no idea what an "arctic" was. Some type of cold lake, evidently. The ship was in
 cruising
 mode, on the N-9573 Packing Route, carrying cargo for perhaps five dozen companies in the hold. Aldri was
 behind
 the
 desk of the observation room, reading some story about some far off world. They were still keeping an eye on
 the
 monitors, just in case something would demand their attention.
 </p>

 <p>
 A flashing red light, accompanied by a bassy buzz, did just that. It was the olfactory alarm, alerting of a
 fire
 in
 the kitchen. Aldri dropped what they were reading and ran to the kitchen. It seemed that they had forgotten
 about
 the pancakes they made. Oops. They put the fire out quickly and tidied up the mess left behind. Finally,
 they
 deactivated the ringing alarm from the kitchen and returned back to the observation room.
 The alarm was interesting in and of itself though. Such alarms replaced regular smoke alarms on most Fleet
 vessels a
 number of centuries ago, although no one knows any more why exactly this change was necessary.
 </p>

 <p>
 But in the darkest corner of the most hidden virtual basement, a few whispered sentences explained that the
 real
 reason was far more sinister than anything that could be made up. It involved something that the
 space-faring
 crews
 were exposed to in large amounts, and something that soon spread to almost all inhabited worlds. But those
 whispers
 remained whispers, until a chance call between one very clumsy pilot, and a brilliant, albeit eccentric,
 professor.
 </p>

 <p>
 Upon arriving at the controls of the observation room, Aldri accidentally tripped over the seat, causing a
 lever
 to
 flip that disengaged the torsion stabilisers. Such a move would have destroyed the ship instantly if it
 wasn't
 for
 the now standard safety protocols in place. However, the safety protocols merely prevented the ship
 exploding,
 and
 did not care where the ship ended up, as long as the ship itself was intact. Aldri's error had resulted in
 the
 ship
 being dislocated in multiple dimensions. On the viewscreen, an image of a cloudy purple planet was filling
 up
 the
 field of view. Getting impossibly large, as if viewed through a fisheye lens, it then grew smaller again,
 until
 it
 started to grow in size again, but this time with no bizarre distortions.
 </p>

 <p>
 Aldri sat there in shock watching this planet grow closer and closer, with its multi-layered bands of
 lavender
 clouds, and continents and rivers of grey, green and purple stretching for thousands of kilometres. It
 exuded an
 emotional aura that completely overwhelmed them. Aldri burst into tears as the ship began to automatically
 engage
 hard re-entry procedures, and within moments had fallen asleep.
 </p>

 <p>
 Aldri woke up some hours later on the floor of the observation room. The room looked like it had taken a
 battering,
 but nothing had been broken. The ship had landed safely in a bank of purple and green vegetation. After
 summoning up
 the energy to head out, they did so. Spacesuit donned, they headed out the main door.
 </p>

 <p>
 The land was a gently rolling landscape, rich in both usual and unusual vegetation. Greyish purple stones
 dotted
 the
 landscape, and upon further inspection, the odd ruined stone building was to be seen in the distance. Aldri
 decided
 to pay one of them a visit.
 The distinct Neo-Gorthonic architecture was a marvel to look at. Arches and pillars radiated a sense of
 purpose
 and
 stability. Unexpectedly, Aldri's communicator rang. That shouldn't be possible, they thought. There could no
 transmission towers here, if this really was hopelessly far from civilisation.
 Cautiously, Aldri answered.
 "...so anyway, that's why I'm out here looking at yet another old well, my signal's gone all fucky, the long
 wave
 frequencies are most bizarre. And there's a weird sensation in my nose..." a voice said.
 "Who is this?" Aldri replied.
 "What? Who's there? How are you picking this up?" the Professor replied.
 "I'm Aldri and my ship has been displaced out of reality. I shouldn't be able to pick up any symbols from
 civilisation."
 "Oh. Oh YES! Wait... that means that these structures are indeed working on a far vaster scale than we
 previously
 thought. Oh right. Introductions. My name is Dr. Karl Hasselstrom and I'm from the Planetary Institute."
 "Aldri Collins, cargo pilot working most of the regional cargoways. I landed on this planet, it's all
 covered in
 purple and green vegetation, and the architecture is weird. I think I read about this. Neo-Gorthonic or
 something..."
 "Oh my. Do you see any well-like structures?"
 "Yes I'm beside one right now. You called me just as I walked up to it."
 Neo-Gorthonic architecture was unusual in that wells and fonts featured unusually often, even when the
 building
 didn't require them. It was said that their wells had a mental influence over anyone who was near them. The
 professor had done a great deal of research on Neo-Gorthonic architecture, but until now could not show that
 the
 wells he was researching were of that style. But this call across dimensions proved it. The Neo-Gorthonic
 style
 developed thousands of years ago from the Gorthonic style of the ancient Kollini, who disappeared along with
 their
 planet. No one had yet been able to provide an explanation for the disappearance.
 </p>

 <p>
 "Wait, did you say purple?" the professor asked.
 "Yes." Aldri replied. "Does that mean anything?"
 The professor realised that this was not Neo-Gorthonic. The purple colours, unusually placed wells, and
 unusually
 located planet meant only one thing. Aldri had landed on the planet Kollino itself, and the entire universe
 was
 in
 grave danger.
 The professor spent several hours talking to Aldri, getting them to describe everything they saw in minute
 detail,
 and getting them to measure a wide variety of angles and lengths of various parts of the buildings around
 them.
 About two and a half hours in, the professor lost the signal. He tried in vain to get it back, but decided
 to go
 back to the van after a while, remembering the urgency of what was going on.
 Upon returning to the Institute, he remembered he was due to give a lecture, so he decided to improvise and
 record
 an impromptu presentation on his conversation with Aldri in front of his students. This lecture would be
 livestreamed straight to the Ectropy Committee. The students were lively and engaged, and the students even
 had
 a
 pint or two to drink while they asked the professor questions. After the lecture, the Professor returned
 home,
 tired
 and worn out by the day's events.
 The next morning the professor was found dead in the local river, with purple liquid oozing from his lungs.
 His
 death was ruled as an accidental drowning, despite protests to the contrary. The Ectropy Committee never saw
 the
 livestream. It seemed that someone else had impersonated them during the professor's presentation.
 Additionally,
 the
 professor's file system was found to have been wiped remotely the morning his body was discovered.

 <p>
 "We all know the story of how animals are able to detect imminent disasters before humans can. However, this
 is
 not
 to say that humans lack psychic capacity altogether."
 -quote from Dr. Karl Hasselstrom's S4 paper
 </p>

 <p>
 Although Hasselstrom's computer was wiped, there was a backup transmitted directly to the Ectropy Committee
 shortly
 before his death. He knew that he was dealing with political forces beyond his control, indeed beyond this
 universe.
 The gist of one of Hasselstrom's latest papers was that the sense of smell (dubbed "S4" per Maynard's
 classification
 scheme), was the human sense that was most sensitive to psychic energy. An individual's psychic abilities
 were
 generally proportional to the acuity of their sense of smell (although there were a number of notable
 exceptions
 to
 this rule, such as the individual known as AY).
 Using historical and current data, he plotted the sensitivity of the human sense of smell over time, and
 came
 upon a
 startling conclusion. It was decreasing, and at an accelerating rate. There was no known etiological cause
 for
 this,
 given that issues like viral infections and pollution had been solved after the end of the Dark Ages. His
 conclusion
 was that some unknown force was destroying humanity's psychic powers by causing olfactory neurons to undergo
 cell
 myeliosis. He triangulated the position of the origin of this attack, and came to the conclusion that it
 originated
 externally to our universe. This corroborated Aldri's reports. It was definitely Kollino.
 He estimated that within 10 years, all of reality would cease to exist in a form recognisable to humans, as
 the
 damage would first cause complete anosmia in humans, followed by further changes in the brain that would
 cause
 humans to be unable to perceive the existence of each other.
 This psychic implosion would send ripples back through time all the way to the start of the universe, at
 which
 point
 everything would never have existed.
 By this point in time, the only physical trace of the Kollini was their planet, cast adrift just outside our
 universe. However, the Kollini had not yet been able to reach the level of power of the Ancient Masters. To
 do
 this,
 they must destroy all psychic barriers to complete domination. Namely, the only other beings in existence
 with
 any
 awareness of the Ancient Masters. Humanity. Thus their focused attack on humanity from outside our universe,
 as
 their near-god like level allowed great power but not yet omnipresence.
 </p>

 <hr>
 <h2>6</h2>

 <p>
 "...So it's permanently diminishing the psychic capacity of the human race?"
 </p>

 <p>
 "Precisely. The destruction of S4 is exactly this—the link between smell and memory, and memory and meaning,
 is
 undeniable. This must be an attack from an outside force. Look at what happened to the Kollini for example,
 on
 their
 homeworld long ago. Those temples were produced right at the zenith of their psychic potential."
 </p>

 <p>
 "So that's the cause of the impossible angles in their geometry? And the purple-beyond-purple of their
 cathedrals?"
 </p>

 <p>
 "Indeed. Later architecture reverted to a much simpler design, bringing it much closer to our conception of
 reality.
 When their powers were almost down to what we would consider normal reality, their civilisation collapsed,
 most
 likely within forty years."
 </p>

 <p>
 "Jesus. So they could no longer perceive the very structures they were creating and living in?"
 </p>

 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p>

 <p>
 "So why can we see them today, to a certain degree?"
 </p>

 <p>
 "Ah, well you see, as any building decays, the parts of it that are hardest to sustain usually collapse
 first.
 In
 this case, the concept of architectural unsoundness is substituted for conceptual unsoundness. Of course,
 there
 is
 an element of regular decay too."
 </p>

 <p>
 "Can I get another beer?"
 </p>

 <p>
 "Sure."
 </p>

 <p>
 AY had that conversation had with the Professor a few years ago, back at the Institute. "I'm pretty sure
 that's
 all
 gone now too, washed away into the metaphorical sea." he thought.
 </p>

 <p>
 AY sat on the entrance steps of the ruins of a chapel carved out of brilliant purple stone, whose ragged
 walls
 seemed to stretch into the deep azure sky about 30% higher than they actually did. His travels had landed
 him on
 Kollino, a lonely planet not usually accessible via conventional means. Much of its terrain was rolling
 scrubby
 fields, interspersed with thousands of ruined buildings of various shapes and sizes.
 </p>

 <p>
 The universe had become much lonelier recently, with many aspects of existence flickering in and out before
 finally
 bowing out gracefully. Kollino was one of the last places one could simply sit down and think about how the
 universe
 was screwed.
 </p>

 <p>
 A strange feeling of calm washed over him. He had finally freed himself of all desire, all pain, all
 worries. I
 thought about that ancient spiritual leader, who said that he wanted to die with no ill will towards anyone.
 AY
 admired that. Perhaps he really would have gotten on with him.
 </p>

 <p>
 The universe was telling him one thing: "It's okay. Don't be afraid. There was nothing you can do."
 </p>

 <p>
 "Just my luck to be the last human being in existence," thought AY. "What a joke to send the most boring
 person
 ever, and a Junior Researcher at that, to some far off world mere days before most of reality pancaked in on
 itself."
 </p>

 <p>
 Still, AY probably had anywhere between a few minutes and the rest of his life on this world. AY knew barely
 anything about the Kollino sect, and now he was the only person to even know the word Kollino.
 </p>

 <p>
 "And this is the Caash Culin". The font of meaning." said the Professor. "There are still hundreds of these
 visible
 all over Kollino today. When the proper incantations were said, they would transform any liquids in them
 into
 something that does not quite align with our conception of physics."
 </p>

 <p>
 "Professor Hasselstrom. What a legend. Shame I didn't take more of an interest in Outer Civilisations of the
 Ectropic Plane OC1102 during my second semester."
 </p>

 <p>
 "Wait. Our conception of physics. AY, you fool! The professor said the force was from outside the universe!
 You
 are
 outside the universe! But that means... no... that can't be right."
 </p>

 <p>
 "The Kollini are doing this to humanity. But didn't they die out long ago? Why would they destroy their own
 planet?
 Oh, they no longer physically exist. This planet is like a shell discarded by a snail."
 </p>

 <p>
 AY looked to the horizon but it seemed further than normal. Around him, the fields and trees were turning
 purple
 and
 getting further away, yet he felt that they were larger in his field of vision.
 </p>

 <p>
 He felt his limbs lengthening and occupying positions they were a few seconds ago, or were to have in a few
 seconds'
 time. His awareness of the immediate present broadened to perhaps ten seconds on either side, and yet
 narrowed
 to
 the exact shifting moment in time marking the present.
 </p>

 <p>
 Anything beyond a few dozen metres away had faded from his awareness, leaving a gap that was neither bright
 nor
 dark.
 </p>

 <p>
 The ruins faded away as he clutched onto a cornerstone of the chapel. In an instant the entire cultural
 history
 of
 the Kollini flashed through his mind. AY was there, in the ceremonies, watching them construct and
 reconstruct
 new
 ways of existing over and over.
 </p>

 <p>
 Reality was shrinking further and now there was little more than AY and this corner of the building. The
 sphere
 of
 his senses grew brighter and brighter, but still purple, until it suddenly expanded to larger than the
 universe,
 and
 he realised that it didn't make sense to keep existing.
 </p>

 <p>
 "The Kollini won," he said with his last breath, everywhere.
 </p>

 <p>
 Then he too gave up.
 </p>

 <hr>
 <h2>7</h2>

 <p>
 And with that the Kollini became the Ancient Masters themselves. They always were the Ancient Masters. The
 universe
 snapped back to reality and humanity was back once more. Kollino and its former denizens were nothing but a
 whisper.
 But still something didn't smell right...
